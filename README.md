# ESU
This interactive simulation demonstrates the synergy between Material Intelligence (ESU) and Conventional Computing (CPU). It embodies the principle of 'Electronic Instinct' where 100 ESU cells handle 90% of navigation tasks reflexively, allowing the processor to intervene only during total spectral ambiguity.
